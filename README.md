# COG - Scripts for setting up NCBI's COG function database

When annotating a microbial metagenome or metatranscriptome, organism annotations are often not enough - sometimes, functional annotations are also desired.  One useful database for functional annotation of genomes is the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), run by NCBI ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/)).  

These COG files can be downloaded directly from NCBI's FTP site ([ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/COG/COG2014/data/](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/COG/COG2014/data/)), but they aren't immediately structured in a searchable form if using a high-speed aligner like DIAMOND.  This repo contains a few quick scripts to get a workable merged database file for use as a DIAMOND reference.
